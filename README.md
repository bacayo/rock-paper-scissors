# Rock Paper Scissors
Simple implementation of Rock Paper Scissors.

This is my first HTML/CSS/JS project. 

# First stage of the game dev
* Nothing interesting. Playing with game logic. No css no html just js.

# Second Stage of the game dev
* Deepened knowledge of css. It was quite good to see how i improved.
* Learned basic manipulation of elements through using DOM. I am still uncomfortable but working on it.
* Callback functions and events was complicated at first, no big deal now.

Live version of the game is <a href="https://bacayo.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/" target="_blank">here</a>
